			<h1>Welcome</h1>
			<p>The Code Society Club at the American College of Sofia is made up of students with an interest towards informatics. The Club is full of enthusiastic personalities, helped by the occassional pizza party. 
			We have our doors wide open towards any 
			new members willing to join in. No amount of skill is required, only the desire to learn. And, needless to say, you'll enjoy the ride. 
			We work on many different group projects, such as: video games, websites, and possibly others in the future. 
			Personal projects are also encouraged. If you want to enter a competition, you'll receive support of many kinds from the community here.</p>

			On December 20th after classes (instead of a meeting) we plan on visiting TechnoMagicLand - amazing place in Sofia Tech Park. It is magical - there are a lot of experiments. The entrance fee for children under 14 is 4 lv and for over 14 - 7 lv. If we are enough, we can ask for reductions, and we will pay the fee for kids under 14. <br> You can say if you want to come until Thursday, because I need to make a Field Trip Approval Request. <br> You will be given 2 CAS.
